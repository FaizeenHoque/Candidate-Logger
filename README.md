# Candidate-Logger

This Python script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application for managing a list of candidates, including their genre, name, and age. The application allows users to add and remove candidates from a CSV file, which serves as a simple database. The GUI features input fields for the candidate's details, buttons to add or remove candidates, and a listbox to display the current list of candidates. By ensuring that all fields are filled before adding a candidate and generating a unique ID for each candidate, the application maintains data integrity and user-friendliness.

The application is useful in scenarios where a small-scale, user-friendly candidate management system is needed, such as in event planning, small organizations, or educational settings. It provides a straightforward way to store and manage candidate information without requiring extensive database management knowledge. The use of CSV files makes the data easily accessible and transferable, ensuring that it can be viewed and edited with common spreadsheet software if needed. The ability to remove candidates by their ID also ensures that the list remains up-to-date and accurate.

Additionally, the application enhances productivity by automating the candidate management process. The GUI simplifies interactions, reducing the likelihood of errors that could occur with manual data entry. The visual display of candidates allows for quick reference and easy updates, which is particularly useful during events or when multiple people are managing the list. Overall, this script demonstrates how Python and Tkinter can be employed to create practical and efficient desktop applications for everyday tasks.
